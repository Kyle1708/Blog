我是哈尔滨工业大学深圳校区的学生，实在是无聊便在高三开始了网页的建设，如今过去了好久，网站建设的逐渐完善。

实力太过于弱小没能去到理想大学。

我非常赞赏[こくしぼう]()的精神，那种想尽一切办法变强，超越的品格。

I am a student from Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen). I started building the website in my third year of high school because I was really bored. Now, it has been a long time and the website construction is gradually improving.

I ah, unfortunately, my strength was too weak to get to my ideal university. However.

I greatly appreciate the spirit of [こくしぼう](), his character of striving to become stronger and surpass through every means possible.
